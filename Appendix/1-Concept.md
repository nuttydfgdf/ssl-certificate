Security with HTTPS and SSL 
The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)—now technically known as Transport Layer Security (TLS)—is a common building block for encrypted communications between clients and servers. It's possible that an application might use SSL incorrectly such that malicious entities may be able to intercept an app's data over the network. To help you ensure that this does not happen to your app, this article highlights the common pitfalls when using secure network protocols and addresses some larger concerns about using Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI).

Concepts
In a typical SSL usage scenario, a server is configured with a certificate containing a public key as well as a matching private key. As part of the handshake between an SSL client and server, the server proves it has the private key by signing its certificate with public-key cryptography.
