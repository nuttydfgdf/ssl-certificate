## Create the server key and certificate

mkdir -p ./var/certs/server
cd ./var/certs/server

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes \
  -keyout server.key -out server.crt -subj "/CN=nginx.local" \
  -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:*.nginx.local,DNS:nginx.local,IP:127.0.0.1"

Now, your .key .csr file will be created.
Output File:
*   server.key This is private key.
*   server.crt This is Certificate.


Extra OpenSSL Commands for Checking and Verification
You can use the following command to check a private key

```
openssl rsa -in server.key -check
openssl x509 -in server.crt -text -noout
```

### Create ssl_client_certificate file.
Create the ssl_client_certificate file. to accept clients that will request their own certificate that matches this file.
We currently have no clients. So we will create an empty file.
```
touch trust-client.crt
```

cd ../../..

### Start Nginx

docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs

Try to access.
curl -vk --resolve nginx.local:443:127.0.0.1 https://nginx.local


## Create the client key and certificate

```shell
mkdir -p ./consumer/certs
cd ./consumer/certs

# Create a customer key and certificate for Consumer-A.
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout client-a.key -out client-a.crt -subj "/CN=Consumer-A"

# Create a customer key and certificate for Consumer-B.
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout client-b.key -out client-b.crt -subj "/CN=Consumer-B"
```

### (Optional) If you would like to convert file format
The next step is to combine both of them together as PKCS12 file so that you can import them into the clientâ€™s browser for mutual TLS authentication. It will prompt you for password. Simply click enter to create a PKCS12 file without a password.
```
openssl pkcs12 -export -out client.pfx -inkey client.key -in client.crt
```

openssl pkcs12 -info -in client.pfx

cd ../../..

openssl pkcs12 -in client.pfx -out client.pem
openssl x509 -in certificatename.cer -outform PEM -out certificatename.pem


## Apply Mutual TLS Authentication to Nginx server.

Add the following lines to enable mutual TLS authentication with nginx
```
    #Enable mTLS
    ssl_client_certificate  /etc/nginx/ssl/trust-client.crt;
    ssl_verify_client       on; #on | off | optional | optional_no_ca;
    ssl_verify_depth        2;
```

Add the clients you accept to the file. ssl_client_certificate:

cat ./consumer/certs/client-a.crt > ./var/certs/server/trust-client.crt

Try again to access the nginx home page.

! Congratulation your server protected using Mutual TLS Authentication.

> If you have multiple client certificates, simply concatenate them into one single file as follows.

```
cat cert1.crt cert2.crt > certs.pem
```

## Access Nginx with client certificate.
### Try without client certificate.
```
curl https://127.0.0.1 -k
```
![a](./images/Code_bUCNzme9wA.png)

### Try with client certificate.
```
curl --key ./consumer/certs/client-a.key --cert ./consumer/certs/client-a.crt https://127.0.0.1 -k
```
![a](./images/Code_jNXG1o5v6h.png)


### Try with client certificate(client-b).
```
curl --key ./consumer/certs/client-b.key --cert ./consumer/certs/client-b.crt https://127.0.0.1 -k
```

Your request has been denied. because the client-b certificate doesn't match the nginx server.
![a](./images/Code_Y6Y0KnhJoe.png)


Fix this, Add the clients you accept to the file. 
```
cat ./consumer/certs/client-a.crt ./consumer/certs/client-b.crt > ./var/certs/server/trust-client.crt
```

Once you are done, the next step is to verify your configuration file via the following command to make sure that there is no error.
Using "nginx -t"
```
docker-compose exec nginx-sandbox nginx -t
```

**Important**, After you add certificate in nginx server this need to reload configuration.
```
docker-compose exec nginx-sandbox nginx -s reload
```

Try again to request with client-b certificate
```
curl --key ./consumer/certs/client-b.key --cert ./consumer/certs/client-b.crt https://127.0.0.1 -k
```

```
curl --key ./consumer/certs/client-b.key --cert ./consumer/certs/client-b.crt https://127.0.0.1/httpbin/anything -k
```
